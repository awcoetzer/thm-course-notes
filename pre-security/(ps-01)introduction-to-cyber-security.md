### â€¢ Offensive Security Intro
#### **Task 1** &mdash; What is Offensive Security?
**_"To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."_**<br>
This is the core of Offensive Security. It involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting bugs in software and finding loopholes within applications that can be exploited to grant unauthorized access. Offensive Security's goal is to understand a hackers tactics to benefit our own systems against attacks.

**Answer the questions below** <br>
Which of the following options better represents the process where you simulate a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system?

- [x] Offensive Security <br>
- [ ] Defensive Security

<br>

#### **Task 2** &mdash; Hacking your first machine
In this section we will be simulating a offensive security, our target being Fakebank, while using a CLI tool known as **Gobuster** to brute-force Fakebanks website to see the hidden web pages. **Gobuster** will take a list of potential page or directory names and try accessing a website with each result, if the page exists, it will tell you through the status code of 200.

Our first step is to open the terminal, also known as the Command Line Interface, CLI for short, We going to explore Gobuster. Most companies have an admin portal page, which in turn gives staff access to basic admin controls for day to day use, as in transferring money to and from accounts. 

Due to human error, some of these pages are not made private, allowing attackers to find hidden pages that show or give access to hidden pages. To simulate this, we will use Gobuster to find any hidden pages by inputting the command `gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir`.

In the command above, -u is used to state the website we're scanning, -w takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.

After running said command, Gobuster will give us some results as shown below. Pages that are accessible are once again indicated by the status code 200.

Now that we have found the admin portal page that allows us to transfer money between accounts and we can connect to `http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer` we as ethical hackers who have permission, would report this to the bank.

Our mission to fully simulate a hack, is to transfer the amount of $2000 from account 2276 to 8881, if successful, you should see the answer to the following question.

**Answer the questions below** <br>
Above your account balance, you should now see a message indicating the answer to this question. Can you find the answer you need?

- [x] BANK-HACKED

<br>

#### **Task 3** &mdash; Careers in cyber security
#### What careers are there?

Here are a few careers within Offensive security roles:

- Penetration Tester
  - _is responsible for testing technology products for exploits and vulnerabilities_ 
- Red Teamer
  - _Plays the role of an attacker, attacking an organization and providing feedback to the company_
- Security Engineer
  - _Designs, Monitors & Maintains security controls, networks and systems to help prevent cyberattacks_
